# MyDigitalPortfolio

Hello Visitor,

This Digital Portfolio contains different scripts and code snippets created during my school and private work period within the last 5 year. Now and then I try to upload much more of my work, so bare with me.. In here you can find Python scripts, Linux bash scripts, JS, XXS scripts and much more. Most of the work created are a mixture of my own input as wel as from the internet.

Feel free to use w/e you want.

Kind Regards,
Hisk.

p.s. If I, for some reason, forgot to put credits to "your!" code, please let me know!
